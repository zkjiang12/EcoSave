# Vision
Our goal is to help fight climate change by increasing awareness to our own consumption habits. This idea focuses on actively reducing emissions, instead of reacting to pollution and other environmental issues. By using a chrome extension we display the total money spent in a certain time frame along with the corresponding co2 emissions. This forces the user to aknlowedge their spending habits and vividly see the amount they spent/what they spent it on. Thus we are forced to reckon with our impulsive and wasteful purchases. Now, with their spending habits in mind, some(not all) will be more inclined to reduce their spending. 

In addition, the co2 emitted will also be paired with equivalent statistics that more vividly display the emissions in understandable terms, co2 emissions coressponding to X number of trees cut down or X number of hours driving a gas powered car. This will heighten awareness of our impact on the environment which will lead to more sustainable purchases and consideration for the environment. 

This saves the user money AND helps the environment. 

In the future, We hope to partner with Amazon and Google among other companies for use on their platform. We plan on displaying the corresponding co2 emissions of each product which will further allow users to make more environmentally friendly decisions.


### Current Stage
Currently, we have the basic functionality of the chrome extension completed, but have yet begun adapting the UI for different users. This will be added shortly by using firebase authentication and firestore databases. 

Next we plan on improving the UI and deploying the extension into the chrome store. 

After, we plan on increasing the prevision of our co2 calculations by accounting for material properties.
